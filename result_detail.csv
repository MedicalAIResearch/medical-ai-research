**reasoning:**

the symptoms (high fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, sweating) are common to several illnesses.  influenza is a strong possibility given the widespread nature of the illness and the presented symptoms. however, the intense itching warrants further investigation into other possibilities like dengue fever, lyme disease (especially if there's a history of tick bites), or even chickenpox (though less likely in an adult).  more information is needed to narrow down the diagnosis.

* **kidney stones:** pelvic pain and blood in the urine are common symptoms.  the vomiting could be related to pain or secondary infection.

* **pelvic inflammatory disease (pid):** pelvic pain is a key symptom, but more information is needed to confirm or rule this out.  the other symptoms don't strongly correlate.

* **gastroenteritis:** while vomiting is a primary symptom, the other symptoms don't align well with a typical gastroenteritis presentation.  further information is needed.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (high fever, chills, muscle soreness, headache, nausea, vomiting) are common to several illnesses.  influenza and viral gastroenteritis are frequently encountered and present with overlapping symptoms. dengue fever and malaria are considered because of the high fever and potential for muscle and joint pain; however, more information (travel history, specific location of residence, etc.) is needed to assess their likelihood.  therefore,  influenza and viral gastroenteritis are flagged as possibilities at this point.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (cough, chills, high temperature, breathing difficulty, sweating, weakness, fatigue, and dark phlegm) are consistent with several respiratory illnesses.  pneumonia is a strong possibility given the difficulty breathing and the production of dark phlegm.  influenza and acute bronchitis are also possible, sharing many overlapping symptoms.  tuberculosis and covid-19 are less likely based solely on the provided information, but cannot be ruled out without further investigation.  the racing heart could be a secondary symptom related to any of the above or an independent condition.  more information, such as chest x-ray results, blood tests, and a more detailed medical history, is needed for a definitive diagnosis.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (cough, chills, high temperature, difficulty breathing, sweating, weakness, fatigue, and thick, black phlegm) strongly suggest a respiratory infection. pneumonia is a prime suspect given the severity and the presence of the black phlegm (which could indicate a serious infection or bleeding).  influenza and acute bronchitis are also possible given the overlapping symptoms, but pneumonia is likely more severe based on the description.  tuberculosis and covid-19 require further investigation through testing to rule in or out.  the racing heart could be a symptom of the infection's severity or a secondary effect of the illness itself.  more information is needed to definitively diagnose.

**reasoning:**

while urinary frequency is a common symptom of utis, the combination of urinary urgency, dizziness, confusion, and vision loss points towards neurological conditions.  ms and nph can both present with these symptoms.  a uti is less likely given the more serious neurological symptoms presented.  more information is needed to differentiate between ms and nph.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms of frequent urination, dizziness, confusion, and vision loss strongly suggest acute angle closure glaucoma as a primary concern.  the sudden onset of these symptoms makes this a high-risk condition requiring immediate attention. a uti can also cause frequent urination but typically doesn't present with the vision loss and significant neurological symptoms (dizziness and confusion) described. diabetes can cause vision problems and neurological issues, but the acute onset of the urinary symptoms makes it less likely than acute glaucoma at this point. more information is needed to rule out or confirm diabetes as a contributing factor or differential diagnosis.

**reasoning:**

the combination of fever, vomiting, and severe joint pain points towards several possibilities.  influenza can present with these symptoms, although the severity of joint pain is less typical. dengue fever is a possibility given the fever and joint pain, but needs more information to confirm.  septic arthritis is a serious infection of a joint and needs to be ruled out given the severity of the joint pain. lyme disease can manifest with these symptoms but requires additional information regarding potential tick bites or exposure.  a flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis is possible, especially if the patient has a history of the condition, but again more information is needed.

5. meningitis - [more_info]

**reasoning:**

the burning, bloody urine, urgency, and frequency strongly suggest a uti.  the headache adds complexity, making prostatitis (if male) and other conditions possible.  however, the symptom profile doesn't definitively rule out more serious conditions like bladder cancer or kidney stones, which require further investigation. the headache could be unrelated or a sign of something more serious like meningitis, but this is less likely given the urinary symptoms.  more information (age, gender, other symptoms, medical history) is needed to assess the likelihood of each condition accurately.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (cough, phlegm, chest pain, muscle aches) are common to several respiratory illnesses.  the loss of smell is particularly suggestive of viral infections like the flu or covid-19, but can also occur with other conditions.  more information is needed to rule out or confirm bronchitis and pneumonia.  a common cold is the most likely initial diagnosis given the duration and symptom presentation, but the other possibilities must also be considered.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (cough with phlegm, chest pain, muscle aches) are consistent with several respiratory illnesses.  the loss of smell points towards covid-19 or influenza, but is also possible with other viral infections. acute bronchitis is a likely diagnosis given the cough and phlegm.  pneumonia is possible, but needs further investigation (e.g., chest x-ray) to rule in or out.  a common cold is always a consideration, however the intensity and additional symptoms suggest something more than a typical cold.  further information is needed to definitively rule out or confirm covid-19 and influenza,  hence the [also_possible] designation, with a preference given to acute bronchitis based on the prominence of the cough and chest pain.

**reasoning:**

headaches, digestive issues (acid reflux and indigestion), sore neck, and visual disturbances are common symptoms that overlap in several conditions.  migraine is strongly suggested by the combination of headaches and visual disturbances. gerd is suggested by the digestive issues. depression and irritability are also present.  however, the combination of these symptoms, especially the visual disturbances and neck pain, warrants further investigation into conditions like ms and brain tumors, although these are less likely based solely on the provided information.  more information is needed to properly assess these possibilities.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms described (stuffy nose, watery eyes, difficulty breathing, chest pain, muscle soreness, loss of smell) are common to several respiratory illnesses.  a common cold is the most likely initial diagnosis given the presentation. however, influenza, covid-19, bronchitis, pneumonia, and allergies can present with overlapping symptoms, making further investigation necessary to differentiate.  the chest pain and difficulty breathing warrant further investigation to rule out more serious conditions like bronchitis or pneumonia.  loss of smell is common in covid-19 but also occurs with other viral infections.  allergies could also be considered if other triggers exist.

the symptoms (fever, chills, vomiting, weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite) are common to several illnesses.  influenza and gastroenteritis are highly prevalent and fit the initial presentation.  however, typhoid, malaria, and dengue fever present similarly and cannot be ruled out without further investigation (blood tests, etc.).  more information is needed to determine which is most likely.

**reasoning:**

* **covid-19 and influenza:** both are known to cause altered taste and smell (anosmia/dysosmia), as well as general symptoms like muscle aches.  since both are prevalent, they are initially considered possible.  further information would be needed to distinguish between them or rule them out.

* **zinc deficiency:**  a metallic taste is sometimes associated with zinc deficiency.  however, muscle and joint aches are less directly linked. more information is needed to assess this possibility.

* **multiple sclerosis:** while less common, ms can cause sensory disturbances including changes in taste and smell, along with muscle and joint pain.  however, it's a less likely diagnosis based solely on the given information. more information would be needed.

**reasoning:**

a metallic taste, altered smell and taste, and muscle/joint aches are non-specific symptoms.  they can be present in a variety of conditions. covid-19 and influenza are common viral infections that can cause these symptoms. zinc deficiency can also impact taste and smell.  multiple sclerosis is a possibility given the muscle and joint aches, but further investigation is needed to rule this out.  more information is required to determine the likelihood of each condition.

**reasoning:**

the lower abdominal pain, pain during urination, and weakness point towards a urinary tract issue, making uti and kidney stones possible.  the ""exploding"" sensation during urination is a more severe symptom that warrants immediate medical attention. appendicitis is less likely given the urinary symptoms are prominent.  ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts are possibilities if the patient is female, requiring more information to assess.

the symptoms (sneezing, tiredness, sore throat, nasal and throat mucus) are common to several upper respiratory illnesses.  the swollen neck is particularly suggestive of strep throat, although it can also occur in other conditions.  more information is needed to rule out or confirm mononucleosis (which can have similar symptoms but often involves more prolonged fatigue and other systemic symptoms).  common cold and influenza are highly probable given the presenting symptoms.  because strep throat is the most concerning given the swollen neck it has been marked as true, while influenza and common cold are marked as also_possible because they also fit the symptoms presented.  more information is needed to differentiate the exact cause.

the symptoms (chills, vomiting, fever, headache, muscle soreness) are common to many illnesses. influenza and gastroenteritis are highly prevalent and fit the presented symptoms. zika virus and meningitis are considered because of the fever and headache, but require further investigation to rule them in or out.  more information is needed to accurately assess the likelihood of each.  the scratching could point to various conditions, making it inconclusive without further information.

**reasoning:**

* **covid-19 and influenza:** both can present with altered taste and smell (anosmia/dysgeusia), and while less common, muscle and joint pain (myalgia) can be associated with both.  the information provided is insufficient to confirm or deny either definitively.  since both fit the description, one is marked [also_possible].

* **zinc deficiency:**  a zinc deficiency can affect taste and smell. joint pain is less directly linked but possible due to broader effects on the body. more information is needed for confirmation.

* **multiple sclerosis (ms):** ms can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including changes in smell and taste.  muscle and joint pain are also possible, but again, further investigation is required.

**reasoning:**

metallic taste, altered smell and taste, and joint/muscle pain are non-specific symptoms that overlap across many conditions.  covid-19 and influenza are common causes of altered taste and smell, and can present with muscle aches. zinc deficiency can affect taste and smell.  multiple sclerosis and lyme disease can cause muscle and joint pain, but further information is needed to assess their likelihood.  the overlap of symptoms makes it currently impossible to definitively diagnose one over the others. more information is needed to rule in or out specific possibilities.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms of frequent stomach pain, heartburn, and weight loss strongly suggest gerd.  antacid use supports this. however,  weight loss and persistent pain warrant consideration of more serious possibilities like peptic ulcers, gastritis, and even stomach cancer, though the latter requires further investigation.  celiac disease and hyperthyroidism can also present with weight loss, but the gastrointestinal symptoms make them less likely initially.  more information is needed to rule out or confirm these possibilities.

**reasoning:**

the burning sensation, antacid use, and weight loss point towards several possibilities. gerd, peptic ulcers, and gastritis are common causes of stomach burning.  however, unintentional weight loss is a serious symptom that necessitates further investigation to rule out more serious conditions like stomach cancer.  celiac disease can also cause weight loss and digestive issues, and hyperthyroidism can lead to unexplained weight loss as well.  more information is needed to accurately assess the likelihood of these conditions.

**reasoning:**

* **skin peeling and rashes:** this points towards skin conditions like atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis.  both can cause frequent rashes and peeling skin.

* **increased susceptibility to illness:**  this suggests a potential weakening of the immune system, warranting consideration of a secondary immunodeficiency.  however,  frequent rashes could also lead to more frequent skin infections increasing the frequency of illness, making more investigation necessary.

* **shaking hands and shakiness:** this symptom is suggestive of a neurological condition such as essential tremor. however,  it could also be related to an underlying medical condition or medication side effects.

more information is needed to determine the exact causes and to rule out or confirm any of these possibilities.  a detailed medical history, physical examination, and potentially blood tests would be necessary.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented (itching, fatigue, lethargy, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, malaise) strongly suggest liver dysfunction,  specifically conditions causing jaundice.  hepatitis b and c are both transmitted via blood and unsterile injections, making them highly probable.  the history of blood transfusions and unsterile injections further increases the likelihood.

liver cirrhosis is a *possible* consequence of chronic hepatitis, but more information is needed to confirm this.  gilbert's syndrome is a milder condition that can cause jaundice, but the other symptoms make it less likely compared to hepatitis b and c.  further investigation (blood tests for liver enzymes, hepatitis b and c serology) is crucial for definitive diagnosis.

**note:**  the symptoms strongly suggest acute liver failure.  hepatitis viruses (a, b, c) and leptospirosis are common causes of acute liver failure and need to be investigated.  fulminant hepatitis is a rapidly progressing form of severe hepatitis that can lead to acute liver failure.  further testing (blood work including liver function tests, viral serology, imaging) is crucial for a definitive diagnosis.  this is not an exhaustive list and other causes of acute liver failure should be considered.

**reasoning:**

the symptom profile strongly suggests a viral upper respiratory infection.  the combination of high fever, loss of smell, chest pain, and potentially swollen lymph nodes makes covid-19 a strong possibility.  influenza shares many of these symptoms, making it a very possible alternative diagnosis. acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is possible given the sinus pressure, congestion, and phlegm.  the severity and range of symptoms make a common cold less likely.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented (fatigue, weight loss, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, polyuria) strongly suggest type 2 diabetes.  the presence of obesity and polyuria (frequent urination) are particularly indicative.  type 1 diabetes is also possible, as the symptoms overlap significantly, however, the presence of obesity leans more towards type 2.  further investigations are needed to differentiate between the two types of diabetes. cushing's syndrome and hyperthyroidism can cause similar symptoms, such as weight changes and fatigue, but require further investigation to rule in or out.  more information, including blood tests (hba1c, fasting glucose, cortisol levels, thyroid function tests) are needed to provide a definitive diagnosis.

* **influenza:**  influenza shares some overlapping symptoms with pneumonia, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.  therefore, it remains a possibility.

* **tuberculosis:** while a cough and fatigue are present,  further information is needed to assess the risk.  a family history increases the possibility, but more data is required for confirmation.

* **covid-19:**  similar to tuberculosis, a cough, fatigue, and breathlessness could be symptoms, but more information is needed to rule it in or out.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented (fatigue, lethargy, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellow urine, yellowing of eyes, malaise) strongly suggest liver dysfunction, and specifically a type of jaundice.  hepatitis b and c are both viral infections that can cause jaundice and the other symptoms mentioned.  the history of receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections significantly increases the risk of contracting hepatitis b and c.

liver cirrhosis is a possibility, as it can present with similar symptoms and is a potential consequence of chronic hepatitis. however, it's not possible to confirm or deny cirrhosis based solely on the given information.  more tests (liver function tests, imaging) are needed.

gilbert's syndrome is a less severe condition causing jaundice, but given the other symptoms and risk factors, it's less likely than hepatitis. further investigation is needed to rule it out or confirm it.

**reasoning:** the symptoms presented (joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, stomach bleeding) strongly suggest severe liver involvement.  acute liver failure and fulminant hepatic failure are both possibilities given the severity and the presence of coma.  hepatitis a, b, and c are common causes of liver inflammation which *could* lead to acute liver failure, and leptospirosis can also cause liver issues and many of the other symptoms. however, without further testing (blood work, imaging, etc.), a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.  therefore, all hepatitis types and leptospirosis remain as needing more information.

**reasoning:**

the combination of symptoms points towards several possibilities.  pneumonia is highly probable given the cough, fever, breathlessness, chest pain, and phlegm.  the blood in sputum warrants consideration of tuberculosis and lung cancer.  hepatitis is suggested by the yellowing of the eyes (jaundice) and loss of appetite, although the other respiratory symptoms make it less likely to be the primary diagnosis. weight loss, night sweats and malaise are common to many of these possibilities.  further investigation is needed to differentiate between these conditions.

**reasoning:**

the combination of high fever, cough, muscle pain, fatigue, loss of smell, and potentially swollen lymph nodes strongly suggests both influenza and covid-19.  the presence of significant sinus symptoms (pressure, congestion, runny nose) makes acute bacterial sinusitis a highly probable secondary infection or co-occurring condition.  the common cold is less likely given the severity and combination of symptoms present, especially the high fever and loss of smell.

**reasoning:**

* **pneumonia:** fatigue, high fever, breathlessness, and mucoid sputum are all common symptoms.  the family history could be relevant depending on what the family history is (e.g., history of lung disease).

* **tuberculosis:**  fatigue, high fever, and cough (implied by sputum) are classic tb symptoms.  family history is a significant risk factor for tb.

* **influenza:**  influenza presents with fever, fatigue, and sometimes breathlessness, though mucoid sputum is less common.

* **covid-19:**  while less likely given the sputum, it can present with fatigue, fever, and breathlessness.  the severity of the symptoms will depend on the specific variant and individual health status.

note:  this is a preliminary assessment based on limited information.  a proper diagnosis requires a thorough physical examination, further testing (e.g., chest x-ray, blood tests, sputum culture), and potentially other imaging tests.  the [also_possible] designation reflects the overlapping symptoms and the need for additional data to differentiate.

**note:**  the presence of jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), dark urine, and acute liver failure strongly suggests liver-related issues.  hepatitis viruses are common causes of acute liver failure, along with other conditions like leptospirosis and pancreatitis which can also present with some overlapping symptoms.  the stomach bleeding needs further investigation to determine its cause and relationship to the other symptoms.  more information is needed to definitively rule out or confirm specific diagnoses.

**reasoning:**

the constellation of symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, loss of smell) strongly suggests both influenza and covid-19.  the presence of significant nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and swollen lymph nodes points towards a possible acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.  while a common cold is possible, the severity and range of symptoms make it less likely.  since both covid-19 and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are highly probable, one is designated [true] and the other [also_possible].  further testing is needed to differentiate definitively.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented strongly suggest a viral respiratory infection.  the combination of high fever, cough, muscle pain, loss of smell, and significant systemic symptoms (malaise, fatigue, headache) makes influenza and covid-19 highly likely.  the presence of significant sinus pressure, congestion, and phlegm also points towards a bacterial sinus infection, which often co-occurs with viral upper respiratory infections.  the common cold is less likely given the severity and range of symptoms.  while it's impossible to definitively diagnose without testing, the most probable diagnoses are listed with the appropriate flags.  further testing is needed to differentiate between covid-19 and influenza and to confirm acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

**reasoning:**

* **uti:** burning micturition (painful urination) and spotting urination are strong indicators of a uti.  the stomach pain could be related to the infection or a secondary effect of dehydration from the uti.

* **sti:** the combination of itching, rash, and symptoms suggestive of a uti make stis a strong possibility. many stis can present with similar symptoms.

* **allergic reaction:** itching and skin rash point towards an allergic reaction, although the other symptoms are less typical.  further investigation is needed to ascertain a potential allergen and if it relates to the other symptoms.

* **crohn's disease:** while stomach pain is present, the other symptoms are not typically associated with crohn's.  more information is required to assess this possibility.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented strongly suggest a viral respiratory infection.  the combination of fever, cough, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and loss of smell points towards both influenza and covid-19.  the presence of significant sinus symptoms (sinus pressure, congestion,  runny nose) makes acute bacterial sinusitis a strong possibility, particularly given the duration and severity of symptoms.  the common cold is less likely due to the severity of the symptoms (high fever, chest pain, loss of smell).  while a common cold can cause some of these symptoms, the intensity and combination point away from it.  further testing would be needed to differentiate between covid-19, influenza and acute bacterial sinusitis.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented strongly suggest a viral upper respiratory infection.  the combination of high fever, loss of smell, and chest pain makes influenza and covid-19 the most likely possibilities.  acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is possible due to the sinus pressure, congestion, and phlegm, but often follows a viral infection. the common cold is less likely given the severity and range of symptoms including high fever and loss of smell.  the presence of both covid-19 and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis would require further testing to differentiate and confirm which is the primary diagnosis.  therefore, covid-19 is marked as [true] and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as [also_possible] reflecting the need for further testing.  the information provided makes a common cold diagnosis unlikely.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (stomach pain, acidity, ulcers on tongue, vomiting) strongly suggest gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, with gerd being a highly likely contributor to the acidity and potential ulcer formation.  the cough and chest pain require further investigation to rule out or confirm more serious conditions like pneumonia, lung cancer, or esophageal cancer.  however, given the prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, these are less likely initially.  more information (e.g., imaging, blood tests) is needed to definitively assess these possibilities.

**reasoning:**

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (itching, fatigue, lethargy, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellow urine, yellowing of eyes, malaise) strongly suggest liver dysfunction, which is a key feature of viral hepatitis (b and c).  the history of blood transfusions and unsterile injections significantly increases the risk of contracting hepatitis b and c.  

liver cirrhosis is a possible consequence of chronic hepatitis, but more information is needed to confirm or deny this. gilbert's syndrome is a milder condition that can cause jaundice, but the other symptoms make it less likely than hepatitis b and c in this case.  more information, such as blood tests (liver function tests, hepatitis b and c serology), would be needed to confirm or rule out these conditions definitively.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms (itching, fatigue, lethargy, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellow urine, yellowing of eyes, malaise) strongly suggest liver dysfunction, particularly jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).  the history of blood transfusions and unsterile injections significantly increases the risk of viral hepatitis, specifically hepatitis b and c.  therefore, these are listed as the most likely possibilities. other forms of hepatitis remain possible pending further investigation.  gilbert's syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury are less likely given the presentation but cannot be entirely ruled out without more information.

6. hepatitis - [more_info]


**reasoning:**

the combination of chills, high fever, cough, breathlessness, chest pain, and blood in sputum strongly suggests pneumonia.  tuberculosis is also a possibility given the persistent cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and blood in sputum.  however, pneumonia is a more likely immediate concern given the severity and presentation of symptoms.

the other conditions (lung cancer, covid-19, influenza, and hepatitis) are possible given some overlapping symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss), but require further investigation to rule in or out.  the yellowing of the eyes points towards potential liver issues, hence the inclusion of hepatitis.  the swollen lymph nodes could suggest various infections or even lymphoma, warranting more information.  the mild fever alongside a high fever may indicate a fluctuating fever pattern in the disease process.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented (chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, rusty sputum) strongly suggest a respiratory infection.  pneumonia is a likely candidate given the chest pain, phlegm (especially the rusty sputum), and breathlessness.  influenza shares many overlapping symptoms, making it also possible.  tuberculosis and covid-19 are included as possibilities because of the cough, fever, and fatigue, but further investigation (e.g., chest x-ray, specific tests) is needed to rule them in or out.  the rusty sputum points more strongly towards pneumonia than the other possibilities.

**reasoning:**

* **venous insufficiency:** fatigue, cramps, bruising, swollen legs, prominent veins are all common symptoms. obesity is a significant risk factor.

* **deep vein thrombosis (dvt):**  swollen legs, pain (implied by cramps), and potentially bruising are suggestive of dvt.  it's crucial to differentiate this from venous insufficiency as treatment is vastly different.

* **lymphedema:**  swollen legs could indicate lymphedema, but further information is needed to assess this possibility.  the other symptoms don't strongly suggest this.

* **heart failure:** fatigue, swollen legs, and possibly the other symptoms could be related to heart failure.  more information is necessary.

* **liver disease:**  bruising and swollen legs can be associated with liver disease, requiring further investigation.

**reasoning:**

the symptoms presented (chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain) are common to several infectious diseases.  influenza and gastroenteritis are frequently encountered and present with overlapping symptoms.  however, the severity and combination of symptoms also warrant consideration of more serious conditions like typhoid, malaria, and dengue fever, which require further investigation to rule out or confirm.  more information, such as travel history, blood tests, and a full physical examination, is necessary to narrow down the possibilities.
